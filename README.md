# unsupervised_learning_of_action_manifolds
This repository contains MATLAB code and routines to run the unsupervised learning algorithm presented in ISVC 2016 paper and my dissertation. The relevant conference paper is "Unsupervised Deep Networks for Temporal Localization of Human Actions in Streaming Videos" published in International Symposium of Visual Computing, 2016 (ISVC 2016). Please cite the following sources if using any part of code or idea. Thanks.

Also, this code was developed based on the available 'rbm' code on Geoffrey Hinton's webpage to train autoencoders on MNIST data. (http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/MatlabForSciencePaper.html). The temporal learning using CRBM is based of an earlier version of the CRBM code to model motion styles by Graham Taylor. Here is his updated Git repository : https://github.com/gwtaylor/imCRBM. 

Please also cite their relevant papers as well if using this work.

Thanks.
